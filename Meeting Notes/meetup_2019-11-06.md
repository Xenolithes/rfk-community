On the research side, we moved forward with the edited 10-question version of the survey and Marie worked to find the best formatting of the questions in Google forms (still in progress) https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PbSjTsr3mWOU8ZLzr8BL4eajLnJRQH-9WzMPM-YNO2M/edit
We got some feedback from blind-user testing that some people have 0 idea about the talk of building an NFL stadium there, so they read the survey (With its multiple questions asking about a stadium) as more of a push-poll IN FAVOR of the stadium. Which was a good flag and we are considering consolidating some questions re: stadium.
We also started to translate the initial input/output notes into a Google sheet where we can start standardizing the logic statements/values we'll ultimately need, and identify the current holes where we need to get more answers https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qizw2UnuYXyb0gdpfxG9iPriBijsZC6Y83qf0EJHQ3s/edit#gid=0
On the dev side, Hayden went deeper on the standalone survey page. We made 3 recommendational edits to the intiial wireframe: 1) remove the social links at the bottom that would require social pages and would take people away from the survey, 2) change the image of a stadium to a map of the site, 3) have the survey be on the homepage vs requiring an extra click, 4) kill the "why" subpage as we accomplish it in the survey intro text (leave the who we are)
Research team also wrote some draft text to replace the lorem ipsum on the site.
