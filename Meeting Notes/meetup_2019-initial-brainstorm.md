*Initial Project Brainstorm; notes taken by Judy Yang*

## Defining the Project

</b>What:</b> Collect public feedback and opinion on land usage at the former RFK stadium site in Ward 7 of the District.

<b>Who:</b> All residents of D.C.!

<b>When:</b> Timeline TBD

<b>How:</b> What is the best way to gather public opinions in a manner that is accessible for all residents of D.C.?

## What should the tool be?
1. Map first: Create a map a la Sim City where people can draw what the want to be built on the site. Should there be preset objects, or can residents draw anything? There should be stats such as percentage of total land being used by type or purpose. Another option is to have residents draw or describe loosely, and have content creators build out the designs. Can residents vote for their favorite maps and plans?
2. Slider first
3. Slider only
4. Open-ended opinions
5. Pick top 3 categories for development: Provide a list of development options, and residents will pick the top 3.
6. A survey: Most low-tech option, survey monkey, walk around the neighborhood and ask people, interview high schoolers nearby etc.
