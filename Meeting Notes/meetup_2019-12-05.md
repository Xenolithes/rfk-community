# Meetup Notes 12/5/19

Present: Marie, Molly, Jay, Tahina, Nick, Dhruv, Kevin, Lizzie
Tonight's notes taken by Lizzie

## Evening Tasks:
* **Research: Molly, Marie, Jay, Tahina**
	* Review the existing survey on the website and make final edits/notes
	* Look into [Nick's element spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qizw2UnuYXyb0gdpfxG9iPriBijsZC6Y83qf0EJHQ3s/edit#gid=0) and additional data
	* Create new "Land Use facts & figures tab" on element spreadsheet and start adding data -- starting to think about what the land use means in a concrete way (how much space does a Walmart take?)

* **Technical: Dhruv, Nick, Kevin**
	* Research various JS packages for drag/drop/snap-to-grid website structure
	* Start working on updated front-end for main website 

## Additional notes from the evening:

Design ideas for the map:
	* one: svg boxes at the top that you drag and place, stats calculator at the bottom of the screen updates as you work. Features values on how your map benefits the community (i.e. 20% park means X more children can play, etc etc)
	* two: svg boxes on the side to drag and place, other params the same
	* what about floating boxes and have the map be the full screen behind (a la current form site?)

General errata: We need to get on a Q1 sprint schedule to get the tech pieces running
