## Purpose

Build a tool in collaboration with the office of DC Councilmember Charles Allen to collect public feedback and opinion on land usage at the former RFK stadium site in Ward 7 of the District.


## Background

The RFK stadium site is located in Ward 7 and consists of approximately 170 acres. The redevelopment area is currently owned by the National Park Service, and is leased to D.C. until 2038. The current lease limits the land use to stadium and public outdoor activities.  Legislation has been introduced to transfer the land to the government of D.C., which would allow for more development options.

We want to hear what D.C. residents envision for the site.

What type of tool would most effectively engage D.C. residents to share their opinions on how the site should be redeveloped?

## About Our Stack

The current site runs on a Django backend with React.js on the front end. The preliminary survey is a [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/1PbSjTsr3mWOU8ZLzr8BL4eajLnJRQH-9WzMPM-YNO2M/edit?usp=sharing) embedded on our website.
